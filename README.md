# Portfolio

Temporary portfolio site consisting of a resurrected university project from a couple years ago.

Originally it was HTML and CSS only, and it uses mostly default Bootstrap styles. It was deployed using GitHub Pages, but that deployment has since failed; that being the case, I'm going to build a small Express server and deploy it to Google Cloud Platform. This will also allow me to get the contact form to actually send an email if and when it's used.

I completed this assignment in 24 hours. I'm aiming to perform all of these updates within the same time period. I'm retaining the original README below.

**Update**: I went a few hours over my intended deadline and it's still not as polished as I'd like, but the site is now live on Cloud Run at the following URL.

## CS-410: Final Project

Procrastinated mightily and then completed frantically for Intro to Web Development at PSU, summer term of 2022.

Heavy reliance on Bootstrap without too much customization: just trying to meet requirements, here.

The URL used to be: https://jpb7.github.io.
