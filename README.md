# Portfolio

Temporary portfolio site consisting of a resurrected university project from a couple years ago.

Originally it was HTML and CSS only, and it uses mostly default Bootstrap styles. It was deployed using GitHub Pages, but that deployment has since failed; that being the case, I'm going to build a small Express server and deploy it to Google Cloud Platform. This will also allow me to get the contact form to actually send me an email if and when it's used.

I completed this assignment in 24 hours. I'm aiming to perform all of these updates within the same time period. I'm retaining the original README below.

## CS-410: Final Project

Procrastinated mightily and then completed frantically for Intro to Web Development at PSU, summer term of 2022.

Heavy reliance on Bootstrap without too much customization: just trying to meet requirements, here.

The URL should be: https://jpb7.github.io.
